# Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
#
# n² + n + 41
#
# Et turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 39. 
# however, when n = 40, 402 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, 
# and certainly when n = 41, 41² + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.
#
# The incredible formula  n² − 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values n = 0 to 79. 
# The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.
#
# Considering quadratics of the form:
# 	n² + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| < 1000
#
# 	where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n
# 	e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4
#
# Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that 
# produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of n, starting with n = 0.
